How to use website:
YOUTUBE LINK : https://youtu.be/zKbXfq6zOSw
1)	Open index.html in web browser.
2)	You can click on various buttons right at the top stating FCFS, SSTF, ..etc which will take you to the information section of that algorithm along with its illustration.
3)	On the top right there is a team details button clicking which gives information on all team members.
To view the visualization and stuff:
4)	Go to view visualization placed at left side.
5)	Select any of the given  Algorithm to run.
6)	After selecting Algorithm you will have input section at right side and graph visualization at left side.
7)	Now enter the input in all the fields.
INSTRUCTIONS TO ENTER THE INPUT:
1)	Enter the maximum track size (Maximum size should not exceed 200 otherwise the graph will not fit).
2)	Enter the starting track number which is the initial position of read/write head.(It should not be greater than maximum track number which is logical)
3)	In some algorithm you will be asked to choose the direction which is the initial moving direction of read/write head.
4)	Now enter the input one by one by clicking Enter Input.(VERY IMP: Each input track should be less than the maximum track number which is again logical!)
5)	Click on show output to visualize the graph and later on total seek time would be calculated and displayed.
Now Donâ€™t you think this is tedious job running one by one algorithm to calculate total seek time and find out best algorithm for problem?
Solution:
Instructions to compare all the algorithms at once using charts.
1)	Go back to home page and navigate on left panel and go to compare algorithm section and click on charts.
2)	Now after clicking on charts you will view a page asking for inputs.
Enter the inputs as discussed above(Follow the rules).
3)	Click on view graph. 
4)	There are 3 varieties of charts-doughnut chart, bar chart, pie chart. You can view any of it. Also there is a generate report button on clicking it you will be able to download the report.
