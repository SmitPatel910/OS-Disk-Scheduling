## Visualization Guide

### Basic Navigation and Visualization
- **Access Visualization**: [Watch the Video](https://youtu.be/zKbXfq6zOSw).
- **Initial Setup**:
  - Open `index.html`.
  - At the top, click the buttons labeled `FCFS`, `SSTF`, etc., to navigate to the relevant information section for each algorithm, which includes detailed illustrations.
  - The top right corner displays team details, offering insights into all team members' contributions.

### Detailed Instructions for Running Algorithms
- **Starting the Visualization**:
  - Navigate to the visualization area on the left side of the screen.
  - Choose an algorithm from the list provided.
- **Input Section**:
  - Input fields will appear on the right, with the graph visualization on the left.
  - **Entering Data**:
    - Enter the maximum track size (note: the maximum should not exceed 200 to ensure the graph fits properly).
    - Input the starting track number, representing the initial position of the read/write head (should not exceed the maximum track number).
    - For certain algorithms, select the initial moving direction of the read/write head.
    - Sequentially enter each track input by clicking “Enter Input” (each input track number must be less than the maximum).
  - Click "Show Output" to display the graph and calculate the total seek time.

### Advanced Comparison Features
- **Comparing Algorithms**:
  - Return to the homepage, navigate to the "Compare Algorithm" section on the left panel, and select "Charts".
  - Enter all required inputs following the aforementioned guidelines.
  - Click "View Graph" to display options for different chart types including doughnut, bar, and pie charts.
  - Use the "Generate Report" button to download a comprehensive report of the results.

This structured approach provides a straightforward method for exploring and comparing different algorithms, enhancing both understanding and efficiency.
